I edited the BTS featurette covering the scoring of the game, a soundtrack that sought to bring the sound of the 1910's into the present.

As someone with absolutely no musical talent I've always watched scoring featurettes for film and games with awe — so getting the chance to work on one was an exciting challenge. It was a large undertaking given the sheer amount of footage to catalogue, and later synchronise.

As a fan of these featurettes covering the scoring process I wanted to assure one thing — that the footage of the players was properly synchronised to the final score. In so many featurettes they use the footage of the musicians as pure B-Roll, when the whole purpose for watching is fans of the music wanting to witness the creation of the music that we have such a personal connection to.

This was a feat which I'm proud to say was achieved; and well worth having this stuck in my head for months after.

> Play a deciding role in history with this real-time tactical experience as you take charge in the pivotal Western Front from 1914 to 1919.
