All my previous Frontier projects had been building on established properties — so working on _Stranded_ leaving early access was a very different experience. It's gameplay and toolset were constantly improving, and our workflow had to adapt alongside.

Plotted camera moves needed to be completed through their Lua-based modding system, which allowed acces to environmental controls such as atmosphere and lighting.

Given the game is so focused on building and expanding your base we needed to make the bases in the trailers depicted the quintesential _Stranded_ experience. This involved in-game 'location scouting' to hand-pick interesting spots for dwellings, such as a crashsite or an overlook, and taking the time to playthrough hours of the game — ensuring that the base was fully usable and achievable.

## Stranded: Alien Dawn Launch

The first Stranded trailer made at Frontier. We were learning how to push the limitations of the game throughout the process, which I was very thankful for when the one trailer project expanded into 3 with a fraction of the time. While not the prettiest game I feel proud of how I managed to develop and expand what our team were capable of with this title.
