While on F1 24 my main work was their Pro Challenge campaign — a series of videos that pitted the real drivers against their virtual counterparts. The videos were designed to be entertaining for viewers while also providing insight into racing particular tracks, with the drivers giving advice and clarifying their own strategies.
