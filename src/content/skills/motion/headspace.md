During my time at Metro we were approached to create a series of promotional pieces for Headspace.
<br/>
These would need to be looping animations of calm peaceful scenes that would be captivating enough to grab attention on the feed â€” but too not distracting.
<br/><br/>
Each week I pitched and created a scene with characters in-line with Headspaces classic imagery, tying in with the themes of the audio.
