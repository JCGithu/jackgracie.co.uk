Cute animals, colourful environments, what's not to like?

Zoo is a fan (and company) favourite. The art direction, creative building tools, and adorable subjects make it a real joy to work on. I worked on the later DLCs for the game; the Arid and Oceania packs.

## Oceania Pack

This DLC was especially fun. The animals and location were playful, and we were really given time to develop the location. New camera tools were being included in the game as well, making it possible to bring in motion (such as the 180 bat spin) that really let the trailer showcase the characteristics of the animals.

## Arid Pack

A very tight pack, and a real challenge given the maximalist nature of zoo (decorations everywhere!) versus the minimalist environment of the desert. The species for this pack were also much smaller than usual - making it much harder to get quality shots without showcasing low-fidelty textures. I did manage to incorporate some camera moves that would later feed into the Oceania pack, such as the whip pan in the Dama Gazelle enclosure.

**Role:** Edited, Capture
