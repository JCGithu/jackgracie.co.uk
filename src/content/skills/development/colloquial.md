I sought to combine my two lockdown hobbies: livestreaming and coding, in ways that might be helpful for the smaller communities.

On this site you can find a few tools, such as a [custom chat overlay](https://colloquial.studio/streamtools/chatter)with the ability to customise every aspect; from automatically including pronouns from users, to inputting your own CSS-based bezier curves for the animations.

One particular challenge was [Emote Drop](https://colloquial.studio/streamtools/emotedrop), which takes live chat data to pull the emote images and then drops them into a physics simulated browser source. The physics are built using the Rust game engine Rapier and imported via WASM.

Finally there are a few games on the site such as [Twordle](https://colloquial.studio/games/twordle). Twitch, Wordle. Streamers could pick a word or play along with chat and guess either a word or a letter at a time. This is a very clear indicator of the time period of this project!
