## 🌄 Experiences

I'd like anything that's crafty or a one-off experience.
Previous great experiences:

## 📙 Books

I use a platform called [XigXag](https://xigxag.co.uk/gifting/?country_code=GB) for audiobooks instead of Audible, which I'd recommend. They do easy gift cards.

Here is my full 'To Read' list, in no particular order:

<div class="scroll-area">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Author</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {#each Storygraph.children as child}  
        <tr>
          <td>{child.title}</td>
          <td>{child.author}</td>
        </tr>
      {/each}
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Cook Books & Others:

- Aran: Recipes and Stories from a Bakery in the Heart of Scotland
- Lune - Croissants all day all night
- Supa Ya Ramen
- Super Sourdough - James Morton
- The Greatest Traybake Cookbook Ever — John Gregory-Smith
- Hirayasumi, Vol. 1

## 🤷 Misc

- Record player repaired <span class="highlight">(The hinge on the lid is broken, I have no idea who could fix it or how much)</span>
- Nice coffee beans. Caffeinated or not.

## 🎻 Vinyl

You can find what albums I'm after on my [Discogs account](https://www.discogs.com/wantlist?user=JCGracie)! You can buy from trusted sellers direct on the site.

## 🥼 Clothes

- I'm looking to get a lightweight waterproof jacket. Something for daily wear or light hiking.
- Black trainers. Size 11, 10½ if possible. Simple. For everyday use, not running.
- Running shorts. 2-in-1 shorts, preferably with a phone pocket.
- Forest green cardigan.
