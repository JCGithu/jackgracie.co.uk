A cut down BTS Interview with Elsie Bennett (Zoe) and Kaja Chan (Mio) ahead of the release of the game. The scope of this project really changed over time. Originally pitched as a few individual social clips the clear chemistry between the two led to wanting to use more and more footage, eventually becoming a longer form feature.
