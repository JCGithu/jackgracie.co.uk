I was hired by ViewRanger, a social GPS treking app, to create mini documentaries finding unique use cases for the app; this involved researching users, contacting them directly, and organising the shoots. I then met with the subjects, interviewed them, filmed how they used the app in their environment, and finally edited the mini-docs for Viewrangers site, app, and social media.
