For this release I aided in the creation of the Announce trailer and continued editing the Pro Challenge series.

This time the format changed to pitting two drivers against each other and removing the track-analysis aspect. This made for a much cleaner edit, leaving only the exciting moments of the drive, and having the driver able to riff off one another lead to much more personable moments.

While those are waiting to go live here is a social piece introducing the returning Elimination Mode:
