This DLC was especially fun. The animals and location were playful, and we were really given time to develop the location. New camera tools were being included in the game as well, making it possible to bring in motion (such as the 180 bat spin) that really let the trailer showcase the characteristics of the animals.

**Role:** Scripted, Edited, Directed, Capture
