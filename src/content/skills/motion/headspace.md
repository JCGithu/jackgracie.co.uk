# Headspace Animation Project

This project involved creating a series of calming animations for the Headspace meditation app. The goal was to create visuals that would help users relax and focus during their meditation sessions.

## Key Features

- **Smooth Transitions**: Carefully crafted easing curves for natural movement
- **Calming Colors**: Soft blues and purples to promote relaxation
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean, uncluttered visuals that don't distract from meditation
- **Brand Consistency**: Maintained Headspace's visual identity throughout

## Technical Approach

The animation was created using Adobe After Effects with Cinema 4D for 3D elements. The color palette was carefully chosen to evoke feelings of peace and tranquility, using gradients and soft lighting effects.

## Results

The animations were well-received by users and helped increase engagement with the meditation features of the app. The project demonstrated the importance of understanding the emotional impact of motion graphics in user experience design.
