# Pond Time

I originally worked on this to try and get a blend between realistic and cartoonish water. This included experimenting with combining grain and gradients, generating random reactive shapes for the as well as displacement tools for ripples.

## Water Animation Techniques

This project explores advanced water animation techniques, combining realistic physics with stylized cartoon aesthetics.

## Technical Experiments

- Grain and gradient combinations
- Random reactive shape generation
- Displacement tools for realistic ripples
- Realistic to cartoonish water blend

## Visual Style

The animation balances realistic water physics with a stylized, cartoonish approach to create engaging and believable water effects.

## Tools Used

- Adobe After Effects
- Adobe Photoshop
