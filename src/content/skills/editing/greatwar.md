As someone with absolutely no musical talent I've always watched scoring featurettes for film and games with awe - so getting the chance to work on one was an exciting challenge. It was a large undertaking given the sheer amount of footage to catalogue at first, and later synchronising. Being a fan of these videos I wanted to make sure that the footage of the players was properly synchronised to the final score, as so many seem to just use general B-Roll over whatever track is playing. This was a feat which I'm proud to say was achieved -- and well worth having this stuck in my head for months after.
