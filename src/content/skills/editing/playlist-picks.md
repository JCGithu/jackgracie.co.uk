Playlist Picks was a series that I pitched and drove while I was at Metro.

I sourced the guests, arranged the shoot, studio, and cameras, conducted the interview, and completed the final edit. It was a hectic series with a lot of quick turnarounds.

I also made the title sequence and theme tune, which was a fun diversion from the regular work of Metro.
