Stranded's first DLC was a very tight project, and a massive expansion to the core gameplay and story. The difficulty of Stranded was how to convey both narrative and game loop visually, as a majority of it's key moments happen _entirely_ in UI. This meant adapting existing game animations, aligning characters, and trying to squeeze moments out the story out through visible in-game actions where I could.
