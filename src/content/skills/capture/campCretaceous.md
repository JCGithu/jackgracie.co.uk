Tied in with the Netflix series this DLC was quite different from the others. Scripting was completed for character VO that tied into the series, but was sadly dropped mid-production. The horror elements of the Scorpios Rex in this pack are rare for Frontier games, and so it was exciting getting to showcase the darker elements of the game and lean more on the sense of threat that is so iconic in the film series.
