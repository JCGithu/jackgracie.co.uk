All my previous Frontier projects had been building on established properties - so working on this through early access was a different experience. Seeing it's gameplay and building improve, and suggestions implimented, was very satisying. Think early Sims with survival gameplay.

## Robots and Guardians DLC

Stranded's first DLC was a very tight project, and a massive expansion to the core gameplay and story. The difficulty of Stranded was how to convey both narrative and game loop visually, as a majority of it's key moments happen entirely in UI. This meant adapting existing game animations, aligning characters, and basically trying to squeeze moments out where we can.

## Stranded: Alien Dawn Launch

The first Stranded trailer made at Frontier. We were learning how to push the limitations of the game throughout the process, which I was very thankful for when the one trailer project expanded into 3 with a fraction of the time. While not the prettiest game I feel proud of how I managed to develop and expand what our team were capable of with this title.
